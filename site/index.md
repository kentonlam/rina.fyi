Hi there, you can call me Kait.
I'm a program analysis researcher
at the University of Queensland, Australia
after previously completing an
undergraduate degree in computer science + maths.
<!-- student completing my undergraduate thesis. -->

<!-- Most of my experience is in &ldquo;modern&rdquo; web development. -->
<!-- I'm interested in compilers, and formal methods and static analysis. -->
<!-- Currently, I do work on binary analysis. -->
<!---->
<!-- Sometimes, I do coding problems and puzzles like Advent of Code. -->
<!-- Functional programming and theorem provers are exciting! -->

Currently, I do work on binary analysis and binary lifting to facilitate formal methods.
I enjoy making things work, and then making sure they keep on working.

I'm interested in learning about:

- functional programming and type systems,
- dependently-typed proof assistants,
- staged programming,
- logics,
- education and visualisations, and
- user experience and developer experience.

If you want, you can reach me by email at kait(dot)lam(at)uq.edu.au or,
for less formal correspondence,
k(at)rina.fyi or [\@kait\@tech.lgbt](https://tech.lgbt/@kait).

Have a great day! ^^
